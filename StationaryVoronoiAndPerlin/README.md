# Stationary Voronoi and Perlin Noise Loop
This visualization is created using the following three characteristics:
  * Random distribution ("Gaussian") of points - more points found near the center
  * Jittered Voronoi diagram - points act as centers of Voronoi cells
  * Perlin Noise Loop - gives the outer shape of the organism
