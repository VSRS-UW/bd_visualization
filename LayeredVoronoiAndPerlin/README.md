# Layered Voronoi Diagram and Perlin Noise Loop
This visualization is created using the following three characteristics:
  * Layered stationary diagrams with unique color and shape
  * Random distribution ("Gaussian") of points - more points found near the center
  * Non-jittered Voronoi diagrams - points act as centers of Voronoi cells
  * Perlin Noise Loops - gives the outer shape of the organism

**This a visualization is stationary.**
